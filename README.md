# Tic-tac-toe
Simple Tic-tac-toe game made in C# using WPF for visual aspects.

This project was made with the premise of the game having 2-players(non-AI) with some appealing visual animations in a simple tic-tac-toe game.

I plan to add an AI element to the game, however, I am currently working on a physics machine learning in python project so I will update this game with a C# machine-learning commit after my research with ML python.
