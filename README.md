# Tic-tac-toe
Simple Tic-tac-toe game made in C# using WPF with some simple animatons


Hello! this is my first project post, I made this using C# for the functions and WPF for the graphical subsystem. it is still a work in progress but I am proud of what I have made so far. 
The game itself works and can restart, If you wish to play it for yourself feel free to do so;
                1.) Download the files and open up net 6.0 windows file
                2.) Then run the Tic-Tac-Toe.exe file and it should run fine as long as you have the code downloaded as well
               
               
If you have any tips or adjustments that would be beneficial to learning or adding onto the project just send me a message and I'll try my best to get back to this as I am learning C# from scratch.
I am also currently posting my other projects to github so feel free to check those out too when I post them, I love to learn so feel free to let me know if there is anything I could change.
